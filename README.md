# todo-list
A basic todo app which allows users to set tasks for completion.
Tasks can be set with a due-date, as priority or favorite, as well as part of larger project.
User can select a variey of sorts to display tasks (e.g. due today, upcoming, favorites, priority, etc.).

## What I learned
- How to build a basic CRUD app
- How to utilize design patterns to decouple code (e.g. ES6 Modules, Modular Design Pattern and PubSub)
- How to utilize CSS animations to make for a more clean & fluid UI/UX
